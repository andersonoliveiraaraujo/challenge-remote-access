From client A access server A first and execute the command below to allow access to port 8000 on the Centos's firewall.

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8000/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload

Then server A would access server B and execute the same command as above.

I would go back to server A. If I didn't have a web service running, I would install an apache, for example.

yum install httpd24
yum install mod24_ssl

Then I would create a Virtual Host with the content below:

<VirtualHost *:80>

 ServerName servera

 SSLProxyEngine On
 <Location /serverb>
  ProxyPass http://serverb:8000/
  ProxyPassReverse  https://serverb:8000/
  RequestHeader set Host serverb
 </Location>
 
</VirtualHost>

Thus, when client A accesses http: //servera/serverb it will be redirected to port 8000 (http) of server B.

To improve access between client A and server B, a VPN would be placed between them. In the same way as access between Client A and server A.
